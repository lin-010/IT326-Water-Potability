# IT326-Water-Potability
Data Mining Project (IT326) — Water Potability Prediction
# Project: Water Potability Prediction

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze the Water Potability dataset and build data mining models to predict whether water samples are safe for human consumption. We will perform classification and clustering tasks, compare several algorithms, and discuss findings and model interpretability.

## Motivation
Access to safe drinking water is crucial for public health. Classifying water samples as potable or non-potable using chemical and physical measurements can support faster screening and resource prioritization. This project demonstrates applying machine learning and clustering techniques to a real-world environmental dataset.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Water Potability Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle — Aditya Kadiwal  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability  
- **Rows:** 3,276  
- **Columns:** 10  
- **Class label:** `Potability` (0 = Not drinkable, 1 = Drinkable)
